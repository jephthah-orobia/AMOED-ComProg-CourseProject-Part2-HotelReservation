# A Required Project for AMAOEd Computer Programming Course

## Part 2
•	Create a video that shows yourself doing the activity.
•	The video should also show the screen of VS code as the program is coded.
•	The output window should be seen in the video as data is entered and the corresponding output of the program is displayed.

Write a C++ program that will ask for the following input from the user:

```
	Customer Name: 
  Age (should be 18 above):
	Number of guests: (should be integer type)
	Number of days: (should be double or float data type)
```

Determine the corresponding number of guests and rate per day as follows:
	
Number of guests	| Daily Rate
------- |---
1	| 1000
2	| 1,800
3	| 2,700
4	| 3,600
5 | (and above)	4,500


Compute the total payment as follows:

>	Total Payment = rate per day * no. of days \
>	Down payment = 40% of the total payment \
>	Balance = total payment – down payment
